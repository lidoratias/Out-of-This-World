# Out-of-This-World
Out of this World is a game in the Shoot 'Em Up genre developed on the Unity Game Engine with C# programming.
## Gameplay
The gameplay of the game revolves around playing as an alien spaceship, where you fight against evil forces in multiple themes.
You can move around and shoot freely from the front of the spaceship in order to hurt the bosses and win the battles.
The first level is Pirates-themed. It features cannons, skulls, swords, bombs, ghosts and more.
The second level is Magic-themed (Harry Potter style) with a castle, magic hat, lasers, evil hearts, evil eyes and much more.

## Graphics
The game was illustrated completely by me using Photoshop and Illustrator. It features a lot of 2d art.
The art is both Pirate-themed and Magic-themes (as demonstrated later on in the screenshots area).

## Animations
The game was fully animated by me, using 3 techniques on different objects:
- Frame by frame animations, where I painted each and every frame digitally.
- Transform based animations, which is based on size, location and rotation of objects.
- Rigging based animations - some of the 2D art was rigged by me, I mapped all the bones to specific parts in the art and used them to animate objects.
